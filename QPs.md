# Auto-Design QPs

This document outlines the requirements for a framework that can read, understand, and generate test artifacts from various sources of requirements. The framework should be dynamic, adaptable, and capable of processing different input formats without hard-coded logic.
It should summarize the requirements and generate structured test artifacts in formats such as Markdown and JavaScript files.

## **Framework Structure**

- The framework should be structured in a modular way, allowing for easy addition of new features and functionalities.
- It should have a clear separation of concerns, with different modules handling different aspects of the framework, such as reading input, processing requirements, generating test artifacts, and executing tests.
- The framework should be built using Node.js and JavaScript, ensuring compatibility with modern web technologies and frameworks.
- It should use Playwright for browser automation and Cucumber for behavior-driven development (BDD) testing.
- Framework should only "require" not "import"
- The framework should not use any AI or machine learning libraries, ensuring that it is built using standard programming practices and libraries [ because I cannot install any AI locally, I cannot use AI in the framework, I can only use standard programming practices and libraries ].
- I created the basic folder structure for the framework, which includes directories for input sources, output artifacts, and utility functions.

# Context

---

The context of this document is to outline the requirements for a framework that can read and understand requirements from various sources and generate test artifacts based on those requirements.

- I need to create a Framework
- The framework should be able to
  - Read and understand the requirements from a file or from an image, or from a URL or from a single line of text or multiple lines of text or from confluence or from a chat
  - The framework should summarize the requirements in a structured format
  - The framework should be able to generate test artifacts based on the summarized requirements
- The framework should be able to read requirements from various sources:

  - File (e.g., .txt, .docx, .pdf)
  - Image (e.g., screenshot of requirements)
  - URL (e.g., link to a document or webpage)
  - Single line of text (e.g., a brief description)
  - Multiple lines of text (e.g., a detailed description)
  - Confluence (e.g., a page containing requirements)
  - cURL

- The framework should be able to generate test artifacts, such as:

  - Summary [.md file]
  - Test Scenarios [.md file]
  - Test Cases [.md file]
  - Test Data [.md file]
  - Feature Files [.feature file]
  - Step Definitions [.js file]
  - Page Objects [.js file]
  - Test Scripts [.js file]

  **PROCESS**

---

When we prompt the Interactive CLI, with user friendly UI, interactive questions, interactive responses, interactive suggestions, interactive back-and-forth, user-friendly menu, the framework should:

- prompt the user with the options to choose from
- allow the user to select the input source (file, image, URL, text, single line of text, multiple lines of text, Confluence, Playwright codegen recording)
- allow the user to choose one or more input files
- allow the user to choose one or more input sources
- allow the user to input the requirements for single line of text or multiple lines of text
- when user chooses, single or multiple lines of text, the framework should open a .md file with proper BDD, CUCUMBER syntax (template) in the editor (vscode and vscode insider), where the user can input the requirements
- When the user is done with entering the requirements in the .md file, the framework should:
  allow a menu to click/choose DONE.
- Then the framework should process the input requirements
- summarize the requirements in a structured format [.md file]
- generate the test artifacts [feature files, step definitions, page objects, test scripts] based on the summarized requirements
- provide the user with the generated test artifacts in the specified formats (Markdown, JavaScript files)
- allow the user to review and modify the generated test artifacts

- Allow the users to review the generated test artifacts
- Allow the users to run the generated test scripts using Playwright and Cucumber
- Generate a report of the test execution results

Framework should be able to handle various input formats and sources, ensuring flexibility in how requirements are processed and test artifacts are generated.
Framework should use the file name as the base name for the generated test artifacts, ensuring consistency and organization of files.
Example: If the input file is `requirements.txt`, the generated test artifacts should be named accordingly, such as `requirements_summary.md`, `requirements_feature.feature`, `requirements_steps.js`, etc.

For example, if the input file is `requirements.txt`, the generated test artifacts should be named as follows:

- `requirements-summary.md` (summary of requirements)
- `requirements-feature.feature` (feature file)
- `requirements-steps.js` (step definitions)
- `requirements-page.js` (page objects)
- `requirements-test.js` (test scripts)

NO AI should be used in the framework, ensuring that the framework is built using standard programming practices and libraries.
The framework should be built using Node.js, JavaScript, Playwright, BDD, and Cucumber for test automation, ensuring compatibility with modern web technologies and frameworks.

For processing structured data, the framework should be able to read and understand requirements from various formats and we can use libraries like `fs` for file handling, `axios` for HTTP requests, and `sharp` for image processing. The framework should also be able to parse and generate structured data in formats like JSON, YAML, or Markdown.

For scanning images, the framework should be able to use Optical Character Recognition (OCR) libraries like `tesseract.js` to extract text from images. This will allow the framework to read requirements from screenshots or other image formats.

For reading from URLs, the framework should be able to use HTTP libraries like `axios` or `node-fetch` to fetch content from web pages or documents. It should also be able to parse HTML content using libraries like `cheerio` to extract relevant information.

For reading from Confluence pages, the framework should be able to use the Confluence REST API to fetch content from Confluence pages. This will allow the framework to read requirements stored in Confluence.

For reading from Playwright codegen recordings, the framework should be able to parse the generated code and extract relevant requirements. It should also be able to generate test scripts based on the recorded interactions.

For curl requests, the framework should be able to handle cURL commands and convert them into appropriate HTTP requests using libraries like `axios` or `node-fetch`. This will allow the framework to read requirements from cURL commands.

The framework should be able to read requirements from various sources and formats, including:

- Files (e.g., .txt,.md)
- Images (e.g., screenshots of requirements)
- URLs (e.g., links to documents or webpages)
- Single line of text (e.g., a brief description)
- Multiple lines of text (e.g., a detailed description)
- Confluence pages (e.g., pages containing requirements)
- Playwright codegen recordings (e.g., recordings of user interactions)

For example, the framework should be able to read requirements from a file, image, URL, single line of text, multiple lines of text, Confluence page, or Playwright codegen recording, and generate the corresponding test artifacts in structured formats like Markdown and JavaScript files.

================

Please refer attached screen.
I dont want to enter the path.
We have requirements in **requirements** folder in the sub-folders like requirements/text, requirements/images and so.

Can we list files in requirements/text when user chose text inout source...

And when user selects single line or multiple lines text to enter...
We should open a .md with today's date and time in the vscode edotror and allow user to enter requriements.
And we should show a message in interactice CLI, select DONE once finished entering details.
And so, we save the file and process to test artifacts

===============

Can you please explain the step by step flow of the framework with code, code snippets, file names, files being called, methods being called, methods from the file, and how the framework processes the requirements and generates test artifacts?

This will help me understand how the framework works and how it processes different input formats and sources to generate test artifacts.

You exaplanation should include:

- File names,
- File paths,
- Functions being called,
- Methods being called,
- Methods from the file,

During the explanation, please ensure to cover and please mention: file names, file paths, functions being called, methods being called, methods from the file, and how the framework processes the requirements and generates test artifacts.

- How the framework starts and interacts with the user
- How the user selects the input source and type
- How the framework creates and opens files for user input
- How the framework processes the input requirements
- How the framework generates test artifacts based on the input requirements
- How the framework saves and organizes the generated test artifacts
- How the framework allows the user to run the generated test scripts
- How the framework cleans up generated files and exits
- How the framework handles errors and provides feedback to the user
- How the framework uses various libraries and tools to process different input formats and sources
- How the framework ensures flexibility and adaptability in processing requirements and generating test artifacts
- How the framework maintains a structured approach to generating test artifacts based on the input requirements
- How the framework uses the file name as the base name for the generated test artifacts
- How the framework ensures that the generated test artifacts are organized and easy to understand

Let's break down the step-by-step flow of the framework, including code snippets and method calls:

1. **User Interaction**:

   - The user starts the framework via the command line interface (CLI).
   - The CLI presents a menu with options to choose the input source (file, image, URL, text, etc.).

   ```javascript
   const InteractiveCLI = require("./cli/interactive-cli");
   const cli = new InteractiveCLI();
   cli.start();
   ```

2. **Input Source Selection**:

   - The user selects the input source (e.g., text input).
   - If the user selects text input, the CLI prompts for single or multiple lines of text.

   ```javascript
   const inputSource = cli.getInputSource(); // e.g., 'text'
   if (inputSource === "text") {
     const textType = cli.getTextType(); // e.g., 'single' or 'multiple'
     if (textType === "single" || textType === "multiple") {
       const fileName = `requirements-${new Date().toISOString()}.md`;
       cli.openEditor(fileName); // Opens a new .md file in VS Code
     }
   }
   ```

3. **File Creation and Editing**:
   - The framework creates a new Markdown file with a timestamp in the filename.
   - The user can edit the file in VS Code, and once done, they can mark it as "DONE" in the CLI.

```javascript
const fs = require("fs");
const path = require("path");

cli.on("fileEdited", (fileName) => {
  const filePath = path.join(__dirname, "requirements", "text", fileName);
  fs.writeFileSync(filePath, cli.getFileContent(fileName));
  cli.showMessage(`File saved: ${filePath}`);
});
```

4. **Processing Requirements**:
   - After the user marks the file as "DONE", the framework reads the content of the file.
   - It processes the requirements using a `RequirementReader` class that handles different input formats.

```javascript
const RequirementReader = require("./services/requirement-reader");
const reader = new RequirementReader();
const requirements = reader.readFromFile(filePath); // Reads the content of the .md file
```

5. **Generating Test Artifacts**:
   - The framework generates test artifacts based on the processed requirements.
   - It uses a `TestGenerator` class to create structured test artifacts like feature files, step definitions, and page objects.

```javascript
const TestGenerator = require("./services/test-generator");
const generator = new TestGenerator();
generator.generateFromRequirements(requirements, {
  outputDir: path.join(__dirname, "generated"),
  baseName: path.basename(filePath, ".md"), // Use the file name as the base name
});
```

6. **Output Artifacts**:
   - The generated test artifacts are saved in a specified output directory.
   - The framework provides feedback to the user about the generated files.

```javascript
cli.showMessage("Test artifacts generated successfully!");
cli.listGeneratedFiles(); // Lists all generated files in the output directory
```

7. **Running Tests**:
   - The user can choose to run the generated test scripts using Playwright and Cucumber.
   - The framework executes the tests and provides a report of the execution results.

```javascript
const TestRunner = require("./services/test-runner");
const runner = new TestRunner();
runner
  .runTests({
    testDir: path.join(__dirname, "generated"),
    reporter: "spec", // Use a spec reporter for detailed output
  })
  .then(() => {
    cli.showMessage("Tests executed successfully!");
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    cli.showError(`Test execution failed: ${error.message}`);
  });
```

8. **Cleanup and Exit**:
   - The framework allows the user to clean up generated files and exit the CLI.

```javascript
cli.on("cleanup", () => {
  const generatedDir = path.join(__dirname, "generated");
  fs.rmSync(generatedDir, { recursive: true, force: true });
  cli.showMessage("Cleanup completed. Exiting...");
  process.exit(0);
});
```

This step-by-step flow outlines how the framework processes requirements and generates test artifacts. Each step includes code snippets that demonstrate the functionality of the framework, from user interaction to test execution and cleanup. The framework is designed to be dynamic and adaptable, allowing for various input sources and formats while maintaining a structured approach to generating test artifacts.

Now, please DO NOT FIX anything...

Please tell me ...
WHY the framework is not generating the test artifacts based on the requirements in the actual requirement files.
What is the issue with the framework?

What is the BEST way to fix the framework?

Are we following the process and implementation correctly?

## What we thought of the process and implementation is :

- For any given requirement file
- Read the file
- Process the requirements
- Generate the "**SUMMARY**" file first
  - The Summary file should contain the summarized requirements in a structured format
  - The Summary file should be in Markdown format
  - The Summary file should be named based on the requirement file name and "-summary.md" suffix
  - The Summary file should be saved in the "generated/summary" directory
  - The summary file should be ideal, realistic, human readable, and understandable
  - The generated summary file should be useful for the user to understand the requirements
  - The Summary file should be generated based on the requirements in the actual requirement file
  - The Summary file should have properly formatted headings, bullet points, and sections, scenarios, and test cases
  - The Summary file should be generated based on the requirements in the actual requirement file
- Then our framework should use the generated "**SUMMARY**" file [as this is detailed and dynamic to the requirements] to generate the "**FEATURE**" file
- Generate the "**FEATURE**" file
  - The generated Feature file should contain the feature description, scenarios, and steps
  - The generated feature file should have meaningful and relevant feature description, scenarios, and steps as per the **SUMMARY** file [which is generated based on the requirements in the actual requirement file]
  - The generated feature file should be named based on the requirement file name and "-feature.feature" suffix
  - The Feature file should be in Gherkin format, BDD, and Cucumber syntax
  - The Feature file should contain the feature description, scenarios, and steps
  - The Feature file should be named based on the requirement file name and "-feature.feature" suffix
  - The Feature file should be saved in the "generated/features" directory
- Then use the generated "**FEATURE**" file
- Generate the "**STEPS**" file
  - The Steps file should contain the step definitions for the feature file
  - The Steps file should be in JavaScript format, suppiorting Playwright and Cucumber
  - The Steps file should contain the step definitions for the feature file
  - The Steps file should have meaningful and relevant step definitions as per the **FEATURE** file
  - The Steps file should be named based on the requirement file name and "-steps.js"
  - The Steps file should be saved in the "generated/steps" directory
- Then use the generated "**STEPS**" file
- Generate the "**PAGE**" file
  - The Page file should contain the page objects for the steps file
  - The Page file should be in JavaScript format, supporting Playwright and Cucumber
  - The Page file should be named based on the requirement file name and "-page.js"
  - The Page file should be saved in the "generated/pages" directory
- Then use the generated "**PAGE**" file
- Generate the "**TEST**" file
  - The Test file should contain the test scripts for the page file
  - The Test file should be in JavaScript format, supporting Playwright and Cucumber
  - The Test file should be named based on the requirement file name and "-test.js"
  - The Test file should be saved in the "generated/tests" directory

Are we following the process and implementation correctly?

Are we generating the test artifacts based on the requirements in the actual requirement files?

Are we dynamically reading, understanding, processing, and generating the test artifacts based on the requirements in the actual requirement files?

WHY??
What's happening with the framework?

Please review the above process and implementation and let me know if we are following the correct process and implementation.

Please explain the issues with the framework and how to fix them.

============

While generating the test artifacts, I noticed that the page file and step files have lots of syntax issues and are not following the naming conventions

Example page files :
/Users/arog/auto-gen/auto-coder/generated/pages/jira-story-1-page.js
/Users/arog/auto-gen/auto-coder/generated/pages/plp-add-new-employee-page.js

Example step files :
/Users/arog/auto-gen/auto-coder/generated/steps/jira-story-1-steps.js
/Users/arog/auto-gen/auto-coder/generated/steps/plp-add-new-employee-steps.js

Exanple Issues:
class AsPerTheJira-9PagePage {

- I guess the naming convention is not correct here.
- The class name should be more descriptive and follow the naming conventions.
- The class name should be based on the requirement file name and should be in PascalCase.
- The class name should be descriptive and meaningful, representing the page or feature it is related to.

Example Issues:
const As per the Jira 9Page = require('../pages/as-per-the-jira-9-page');
let as per the jira 9Page;
as per the jira 9Page = new As per the Jira 9Page(page);
await x-add-new-employee-arogvyaa-Page.navigate();
await x add new employee arogvyaa @Page.setup('the application is running and the user has access');

- The import statement should follow the naming conventions and should be based on the requirement file name.
- The import statement should be in camelCase and should not have spaces or special characters.
- The import statement should be based on the requirement file name and should be in camelCase.
- The import statement should be descriptive and meaningful, representing the page or feature it is related to.

Please reveiew these files and issues from the generated test artifacts and let me know how to fix them.

Please fix the root causing issues with the framework to ensure that the generated test artifacts follow the correct naming conventions and syntax.

**ISSUE 2** :
From the generated feature file : Test scenarios section is empty and not generated.
And because of the Feature file is not generated properly, the steps file and page file are also not generated properly.
THis is because the framework is not processing the requirements correctly and not generating the real good summry and test scenarios.

## 🧪 Test Scenarios

**ISSUE 3** :
The generated feature file has only one feature, instead of 3 features [from the 3 user stories in the summary file]
This is the only one added : Feature: As Max, I want to invite my friends, so we can enjoy this service together

**ISSUE 4** :
The generated feature file does not contain the scenarios and steps for the user stories.
The generated feature file somehow contains default scenario and steps, which are not related to the user stories in the summary file.

- is that fall-back logic or something?

How can we acheive the following:
- Auto sentence generation for the user stories and acceptance criteria, in the point of view of the user / client, matching the requirements
- Auto sentence correction for the user stories and acceptance criteria, in the point of view of the user / client, matching the requirements
- Auto sentence simplification for the user stories and acceptance criteria, in the point of view of the user / client, matching the requirements
- Auto sentence expansion for the user stories and acceptance criteria, in the point of view of the user / client, matching the requirements
- Auto sentence restructuring for the user stories and acceptance criteria, in the point of view of the user / client, matching the requirements

Also, instead of mixing user perspectives, like, user or I, we should keep the perspective consistent throughout the transformations, for example, always using "the user" or "I" consistently and not mixing them and auto-correcting sentences, statements to be consistent, and matching the requirements.
